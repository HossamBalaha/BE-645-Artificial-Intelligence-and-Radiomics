# BE 645 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Radiomics (Summer 2024)

Welcome to the BE 645: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Radiomics course.

Artificial intelligence is essentially a collection of advanced computational algorithms designed to identify patterns
in given data and predict outcomes for new, unseen data. Radiomics, a relatively new term in radiology, involves
extracting a large number of features from various types of medical images. This course integrates artificial
intelligence and radiomics to uncover valuable quantitative data for practical medical applications. It also covers the
fundamental concepts and applications of artificial intelligence in computer-aided diagnostic systems.

This course offers both theoretical and practical knowledge about computer vision and AI techniques essential for
processing and analyzing radiology images, contributing to the shift towards radiomics. This transition will
allow AI models to assist doctors and healthcare professionals in managing and diagnosing various diseases.
