# BE 645 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Radiomics (Summer 2025) - Updated

Welcome to the BE 645: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Radiomics course.

Artificial intelligence is essentially a collection of advanced computational algorithms designed to identify patterns
in given data and predict outcomes for new, unseen data. Radiomics, a relatively new term in radiology, involves
extracting a large number of features from various types of medical images. This course integrates artificial
intelligence and radiomics to uncover valuable quantitative data for practical medical applications. It also covers the
fundamental concepts and applications of artificial intelligence in computer-aided diagnostic systems.

This course offers both theoretical and practical knowledge about computer vision and AI techniques essential for
processing and analyzing radiology images, contributing to the shift towards radiomics. This transition will
allow AI models to assist doctors and healthcare professionals in managing and diagnosing various diseases.

## Programming Language and Libraries

The programming language used in this series is `Python`, and the utilized packages/libraries are stored in
the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of this repository.

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Disclaimer: The versions of the libraries may change based on updates and releases. However, the code should work
with the latest versions. Please note that the code has been tested on `Python 3.10.*` (e.g, `3.10.18`) and the
and the specified library versions on a `Windows 11` machine.
It has not been tested on other operating systems or other versions of Python and the libraries._

### Anaconda Environment Setup (Optional)

If you are using `Anaconda`, you can create a new environment and install the required libraries using the batch
script `anaconda-tf-environment.bat` file in the root directory of this repository. To run the script,
simply double-click on the `anaconda-tf-environment.bat` file.

This batch script (`anaconda-tf-environment.bat`) automates the setup of a TensorFlow environment with CUDA support
on a Windows system using Conda. It sequentially creates a new Conda environment named `tf` with `Python 3.10`,
activates it, installs the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN libraries from the conda-forge channel, and installs Python
dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt file`. Each step includes error checking to ensure that any failure
halts the process and provides clear feedback to the user. The benefit of this script is that it simplifies and
streamlines the often complex and error-prone process of configuring a machine learning environment with GPU
acceleration.

_Disclaimer: The script is designed to work on a Windows system with Anaconda installed. It may not work on other
operating systems or with different versions of Anaconda. Please ensure that you have the required permissions
to run the script and install the required libraries._

## Dataset and Code

**Dataset**:

***Liver Tumor Segmentation (130 CT Scans for Liver Tumor Segmentation)***

This dataset was extracted from LiTS - Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS17) organised in conjunction with ISBI
2017 and MICCAI 2017.

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/liver-tumor-segmentation

More information: Original dataset is The Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS) that can be accessed from this
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04056

> segmentation benchmark (lits). Medical Image Analysis, 84, 102680.

***Brain Tumor Dataset***

This dataset contains 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images from 233 patients, categorized into three
brain tumor types: meningioma (708 slices), glioma (1,426 slices), and pituitary tumor (930 slices).
The dataset is divided into four subsets, each archived in a `.zip` file containing 766 slices,
along with 5-fold cross-validation indices for robust evaluation.

Each image is stored in MATLAB (`.mat`) format, including fields such as tumor label, patient ID, image data,
tumor border coordinates, and a binary tumor mask.
The images were acquired using a standardized protocol at Nanfang Hospital and General Hospital,
Tianjin Medical University, China, between 2005 and 2010, with a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels and pixel
dimensions of 0.49 x 0.49 mmÂ².

***Brain Tumor Dataset: Segmentation & Classification***

This dataset is a curated and enhanced collection of brain tumor MRI
images derived from two publicly available datasets: the Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI Dataset and the SciDB Brain Tumor
Dataset. It is designed for both segmentation and classification tasks, including identifying tumor types such
as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors, with approximately 5,000 images and ~2,700 segmentation masks. Enhancements
include normalization, noise reduction through Gaussian filtering, contrast adjustments, and structured organization
into directories for images and masks, along with pixel-level annotations and classification labels.

***COVID-19 Radiography Database***

A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, the University of Dhaka, and their collaborators from Pakistan and
Malaysia, in collaboration with medical doctors, developed a comprehensive COVID-19 Radiography Database, which won the
COVID-19 Dataset Award by the Kaggle Community.

Initially, they released a dataset containing 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal, and 1,345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray images.
Subsequent updates expanded the dataset significantly, with the latest update including 3,616 COVID-19 cases,
10,192 normal, 6,012 lung opacity, and 1,345 viral pneumonia images, along with corresponding lung masks.

Additionally, Qatar University researchers compiled the COVID-QU-Ex dataset, featuring 33,920 chest X-ray images
and ground-truth lung segmentation masks, making it the largest lung mask dataset created.
The dataset includes 11,956 COVID-19, 11,263 non-COVID infections, and 10,701 normal images,
with 2,913 COVID-19 infection segmentation masks provided from their previous QaTaCov project.

***[MedMNIST+] 18x Standardized Datasets for 2D and 3D Biomedical Image Classification with Multiple Size Options: 28 (
MNIST-Like), 64, 128, and 224***

MedMNIST is a comprehensive collection of standardized biomedical images, designed to simplify research
and educational activities in biomedical image analysis, computer vision, and machine learning.
It includes 12 datasets for 2D images and 6 datasets for 3D images, all pre-processed to 28x28 (2D) or
28x28x28 (3D) with classification labels, eliminating the need for background knowledge.
The dataset spans various data scales (100 to 100,000) and tasks (binary/multi-class classification,
ordinal regression, multi-label classification), totaling around 708K 2D and 10K 3D images.

Recently, MedMNIST+ was released, offering larger image sizes (64x64, 128x128, 224x224 for 2D, and 64x64x64 for 3D)
to support the development of medical foundation models.
